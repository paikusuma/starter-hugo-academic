Pradiptajati Kusuma is a postdoctoral researcher at the Genome Diversity and Disease Group, Mochtar Riady Institute for Nanotechnology, Indonesia. He is a population geneticist, currently working closely with a nomadic hunter-gatherer group in Kalimantan, the Punan Batu/Cave Punan, one of a vanishingly small number of groups worldwide still occupying karstic rock shelters, living in a network of shifting camps in the forest. Together with collaborators, he conducts a multidisciplinary research to study the Cave Punan (and the neighboring indigenous group) history and the biological impact of lifestyle transition, involving linguistic, social networks, mobility patterns, diet, and genetics. His study is supported by the Wellcome International Training Fellowship program.
