abstract: The appearance of people associated with the Lapita culture in the South
  Pacific around 3,000 years ago marked the beginning of the last major human dispersal
  to unpopulated lands. However, the relationship of these pioneers to the long-established
  Papuan people of the New Guinea region is unclear. Here we present genome-wide ancient
  DNA data from three individuals from Vanuatu (about 3,100-2,700 years before present)
  and one from Tonga (about 2,700-2,300 years before present), and analyse them with
  data from 778 present-day East Asians and Oceanians. Today, indigenous people of
  the South Pacific harbour a mixture of ancestry from Papuans and a population of
  East Asian origin that no longer exists in unmixed form, but is a match to the ancient
  individuals. Most analyses have interpreted the minimum of twenty-five per cent
  Papuan ancestry in the region today as evidence that the first humans to reach Remote
  Oceania, including Polynesia, were derived from population mixtures near New Guinea,
  before their further expansion into Remote Oceania. However, our finding that the
  ancient individuals had little to no Papuan ancestry implies that later human population
  movements spread Papuan ancestry through the South Pacific after the first peopling
  of the islands.
