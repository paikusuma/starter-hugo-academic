 abstract = {The appearance of people associated with the Lapita culture in
the South Pacific around 3,000 years ago marked the beginning of
the last major human dispersal to unpopulated lands. However, the
relationship of these pioneers to the long-established Papuan
people of the New Guinea region is unclear. Here we present
genome-wide ancient DNA data from three individuals from Vanuatu
(about 3,100-2,700 years before present) and one from Tonga
(about 2,700-2,300 years before present), and analyse them with
data from 778 present-day East Asians and Oceanians. Today,
indigenous people of the South Pacific harbour a mixture of
ancestry from Papuans and a population of East Asian origin that
no longer exists in unmixed form, but is a match to the ancient
individuals. Most analyses have interpreted the minimum of
twenty-five per cent Papuan ancestry in the region today as
evidence that the first humans to reach Remote Oceania, including
Polynesia, were derived from population mixtures near New Guinea,
before their further expansion into Remote Oceania. However, our
finding that the ancient individuals had little to no Papuan
ancestry implies that later human population movements spread
Papuan ancestry through the South Pacific after the first
peopling of the islands.},
