 abstract = {The Indian Ocean has long been a hub of interacting human
populations. Following land- and sea-based routes, trade drove
cultural contacts between far-distant ethnic groups in Asia,
India, the Middle East and Africa, creating one of the world's
first proto-globalized environments. However, the extent to
which population mixing was mediated by trade is poorly
understood. Reconstructing admixture times from genomic data in
3,006 individuals from 187 regional populations reveals a close
association between bouts of human migration and trade volumes
during the last 2,000 years across the Indian Ocean trading
system. Temporal oscillations in trading activity match phases
of contraction and expansion in migration, with high water marks
following the expansion of the Silk Roads in the 5th century AD,
the rise of maritime routes in the 11th century and a drastic
restructuring of the trade network following the arrival of
Europeans in the 16th century. The economic fluxes of the Indian
Ocean trade network therefore directly shaped exchanges of
genes, in addition to goods and concepts.},
