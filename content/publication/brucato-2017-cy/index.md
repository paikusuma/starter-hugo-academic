abstract: The Indian Ocean has long been a hub of interacting human populations. Following
  land- and sea-based routes, trade drove cultural contacts between far-distant ethnic
  groups in Asia, India, the Middle East and Africa, creating one of the world's first
  proto-globalized environments. However, the extent to which population mixing was
  mediated by trade is poorly understood. Reconstructing admixture times from genomic
  data in 3,006 individuals from 187 regional populations reveals a close association
  between bouts of human migration and trade volumes during the last 2,000 years across
  the Indian Ocean trading system. Temporal oscillations in trading activity match
  phases of contraction and expansion in migration, with high water marks following
  the expansion of the Silk Roads in the 5th century AD, the rise of maritime routes
  in the 11th century and a drastic restructuring of the trade network following the
  arrival of Europeans in the 16th century. The economic fluxes of the Indian Ocean
  trade network therefore directly shaped exchanges of genes, in addition to goods
  and concepts.
