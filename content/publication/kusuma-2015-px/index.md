abstract: "BACKGROUND: Linguistic, cultural and genetic characteristics of the Malagasy\
  \ suggest that both Africans and Island Southeast Asians were involved in the colonization\
  \ of Madagascar. Populations from the Indonesian archipelago played an especially\
  \ important role because linguistic evidence suggests that the Malagasy language\
  \ branches from the Southeast Barito language family of southern Borneo, Indonesia,\
  \ with the closest language spoken today by the Ma'anyan. To test for a genetic\
  \ link between Malagasy and these linguistically related Indonesian populations,\
  \ we studied the Ma'anyan and other Indonesian ethnic groups (including the sea\
  \ nomad Bajo) that, from their historical and linguistic contexts, may be modern\
  \ descendants of the populations that helped enact the settlement of Madagascar.\
  \ RESULT: A combination of phylogeographic analysis of genetic distances, haplotype\
  \ comparisons and inference of parental populations by linear optimization, using\
  \ both maternal and paternal DNA lineages, suggests that Malagasy derive from multiple\
  \ regional sources in Indonesia, with a focus on eastern Borneo, southern Sulawesi\
  \ and the Lesser Sunda islands. CONCLUSION: Settlement may have been mediated by\
  \ ancient sea nomad movements because the linguistically closest population, Ma'anyan,\
  \ has only subtle genetic connections to Malagasy, whereas genetic links with other\
  \ sea nomads are more strongly supported. Our data hint at a more complex scenario\
  \ for the Indonesian settlement of Madagascar than has previously been recognized."
