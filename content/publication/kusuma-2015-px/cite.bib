 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Linguistic, cultural and genetic characteristics of
the Malagasy suggest that both Africans and Island Southeast
Asians were involved in the colonization of Madagascar.
Populations from the Indonesian archipelago played an especially
important role because linguistic evidence suggests that the
Malagasy language branches from the Southeast Barito language
family of southern Borneo, Indonesia, with the closest language
spoken today by the Ma'anyan. To test for a genetic link between
Malagasy and these linguistically related Indonesian
populations, we studied the Ma'anyan and other Indonesian ethnic
groups (including the sea nomad Bajo) that, from their
historical and linguistic contexts, may be modern descendants of
the populations that helped enact the settlement of Madagascar.
RESULT: A combination of phylogeographic analysis of genetic
distances, haplotype comparisons and inference of parental
populations by linear optimization, using both maternal and
paternal DNA lineages, suggests that Malagasy derive from
multiple regional sources in Indonesia, with a focus on eastern
Borneo, southern Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda islands.
CONCLUSION: Settlement may have been mediated by ancient sea
nomad movements because the linguistically closest population,
Ma'anyan, has only subtle genetic connections to Malagasy,
whereas genetic links with other sea nomads are more strongly
supported. Our data hint at a more complex scenario for the
Indonesian settlement of Madagascar than has previously been
recognized.},
