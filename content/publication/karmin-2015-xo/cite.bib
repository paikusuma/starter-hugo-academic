 abstract = {It is commonly thought that human genetic diversity in
non-African populations was shaped primarily by an out-of-Africa
dispersal 50-100 thousand yr ago (kya). Here, we present a study
of 456 geographically diverse high-coverage Y chromosome
sequences, including 299 newly reported samples. Applying
ancient DNA calibration, we date the Y-chromosomal most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) in Africa at 254 (95% CI 192-307) kya
and detect a cluster of major non-African founder haplogroups in
a narrow time interval at 47-52 kya, consistent with a rapid
initial colonization model of Eurasia and Oceania after the
out-of-Africa bottleneck. In contrast to demographic
reconstructions based on mtDNA, we infer a second strong
bottleneck in Y-chromosome lineages dating to the last 10 ky. We
hypothesize that this bottleneck is caused by cultural changes
affecting variance of reproductive success among males.},
