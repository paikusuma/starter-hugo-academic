 abstract = {The Austronesian dispersal across the Indonesian Ocean to
Madagascar and the Comoros has been well documented, but in an
unexplained anomaly, few to no traces have been found of the
Austronesian expansion in East Africa or the Arabian Peninsula.
To revisit this peculiarity, we surveyed the Western Indian
Ocean rim populations to identify potential Austronesian genetic
ancestry. We generated full mitochondrial DNA genomes and
genome-wide genotyping data for these individuals and compared
them with the Banjar, the Indonesian source population of the
westward Austronesian dispersal. We find strong support for
Asian genetic contributions to maternal lineages and autosomal
variation in modern day Somalia and Yemen. Surprisingly, this
input reveals two apparently different geographic origins and
timings of admixture for the Austronesian contact; one at a very
early phase (likely associated with the early Austronesian
dispersals), and a later movement dating to the end of
nineteenth century. These Austronesian gene flows come,
respectively, from Madagascar and directly from an unidentified
location in Island Southeast Asia. This result reveals a far
more complex dynamic of Austronesian dispersals through the
Western Indian Ocean than has previously been understood and
suggests that Austronesian movements within the Indian Ocean may
have been part of a lengthy process, probably continuing well
into the modern era.},
