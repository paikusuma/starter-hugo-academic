abstract: The Austronesian dispersal across the Indonesian Ocean to Madagascar and
  the Comoros has been well documented, but in an unexplained anomaly, few to no traces
  have been found of the Austronesian expansion in East Africa or the Arabian Peninsula.
  To revisit this peculiarity, we surveyed the Western Indian Ocean rim populations
  to identify potential Austronesian genetic ancestry. We generated full mitochondrial
  DNA genomes and genome-wide genotyping data for these individuals and compared them
  with the Banjar, the Indonesian source population of the westward Austronesian dispersal.
  We find strong support for Asian genetic contributions to maternal lineages and
  autosomal variation in modern day Somalia and Yemen. Surprisingly, this input reveals
  two apparently different geographic origins and timings of admixture for the Austronesian
  contact; one at a very early phase (likely associated with the early Austronesian
  dispersals), and a later movement dating to the end of nineteenth century. These
  Austronesian gene flows come, respectively, from Madagascar and directly from an
  unidentified location in Island Southeast Asia. This result reveals a far more complex
  dynamic of Austronesian dispersals through the Western Indian Ocean than has previously
  been understood and suggests that Austronesian movements within the Indian Ocean
  may have been part of a lengthy process, probably continuing well into the modern
  era.
