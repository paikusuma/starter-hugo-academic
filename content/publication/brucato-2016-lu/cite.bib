 abstract = {Malagasy genetic diversity results from an exceptional
protoglobalization process that took place over a thousand years
ago across the Indian Ocean. Previous efforts to locate the Asian
origin of Malagasy highlighted Borneo broadly as a potential
source, but so far no firm source populations were identified.
Here, we have generated genome-wide data from two Southeast
Borneo populations, the Banjar and the Ngaju, together with
published data from populations across the Indian Ocean region.
We find strong support for an origin of the Asian ancestry of
Malagasy among the Banjar. This group emerged from the
long-standing presence of a Malay Empire trading post in
Southeast Borneo, which favored admixture between the Malay and
an autochthonous Borneo group, the Ma'anyan. Reconciling genetic,
historical, and linguistic data, we show that the Banjar, in
Malay-led voyages, were the most probable Asian source among the
analyzed groups in the founding of the Malagasy gene pool.},
