abstract: Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country, host to striking
  levels of human diversity, regional patterns of admixture, and varying degrees of
  introgression from both Neanderthals and Denisovans. However, it has been largely
  excluded from the human genomics sequencing boom of the last decade. To serve as
  a benchmark dataset of molecular phenotypes across the region, we generated genome-wide
  CpG methylation and gene expression measurements in over 100 individuals from three
  locations that capture the major genomic and geographical axes of diversity across
  the Indonesian archipelago. Investigating between- and within-island differences,
  we find up to 10.55% of tested genes are differentially expressed between the islands
  of Sumba and New Guinea. Variation in gene expression is closely associated with
  DNA methylation, with expression levels of 9.80% of genes correlating with nearby
  promoter CpG methylation, and many of these genes being differentially expressed
  between islands. Genes identified in our differential expression and methylation
  analyses are enriched in pathways involved in immunity, highlighting Indonesia's
  tropical role as a source of infectious disease diversity and the strong selective
  pressures these diseases have exerted on humans. Finally, we identify robust within-island
  variation in DNA methylation and gene expression, likely driven by fine-scale environmental
  differences across sampling sites. Together, these results strongly suggest complex
  relationships between DNA methylation, transcription, archaic hominin introgression
  and immunity, all jointly shaped by the environment. This has implications for the
  application of genomic medicine, both in critically understudied Indonesia and globally,
  and will allow a better understanding of the interacting roles of genomic and environmental
  factors shaping molecular and complex phenotypes.
