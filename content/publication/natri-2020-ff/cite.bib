 abstract = {Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country, host to
striking levels of human diversity, regional patterns of
admixture, and varying degrees of introgression from both
Neanderthals and Denisovans. However, it has been largely
excluded from the human genomics sequencing boom of the last
decade. To serve as a benchmark dataset of molecular phenotypes
across the region, we generated genome-wide CpG methylation and
gene expression measurements in over 100 individuals from three
locations that capture the major genomic and geographical axes
of diversity across the Indonesian archipelago. Investigating
between- and within-island differences, we find up to 10.55% of
tested genes are differentially expressed between the islands of
Sumba and New Guinea. Variation in gene expression is closely
associated with DNA methylation, with expression levels of
9.80% of genes correlating with nearby promoter CpG
methylation, and many of these genes being differentially
expressed between islands. Genes identified in our differential
expression and methylation analyses are enriched in pathways
involved in immunity, highlighting Indonesia's tropical role as
a source of infectious disease diversity and the strong
selective pressures these diseases have exerted on humans.
Finally, we identify robust within-island variation in DNA
methylation and gene expression, likely driven by fine-scale
environmental differences across sampling sites. Together, these
results strongly suggest complex relationships between DNA
methylation, transcription, archaic hominin introgression and
immunity, all jointly shaped by the environment. This has
implications for the application of genomic medicine, both in
critically understudied Indonesia and globally, and will allow a
better understanding of the interacting roles of genomic and
environmental factors shaping molecular and complex phenotypes.},
