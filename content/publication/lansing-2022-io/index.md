abstract: Abstract Theories of early cooperation in human society often draw from
  a small sample of ethnographic studies of surviving populations of hunter--gatherers,
  most of which are now sedentary. Borneo hunter--gatherers (Punan, Penan) have seldom
  figured in comparative research because of a decades-old controversy about whether
  they are the descendants of farmers who adopted a hunting and gathering way of life.
  In 2018 we began an ethnographic study of a group of still-nomadic hunter--gatherers
  who call themselves Punan Batu (Cave Punan). Our genetic analysis clearly indicates
  that they are very unlikely to be the descendants of neighbouring agriculturalists.
  They also preserve a song language that is unrelated to other languages of Borneo.
  Dispersed travelling groups of Punan Batu with fluid membership use message sticks
  to stay in contact, co-operate and share resources as they journey between rock
  shelters and forest camps. Message sticks were once widespread among nomadic Punan
  in Borneo, but have largely disappeared in sedentary Punan villages. Thus the small
  community of Punan Batu offers a rare glimpse of a hunting and gathering way of
  life that was once widespread in the forests of Borneo, where prosocial behaviour
  extended beyond the face-to-face community, facilitating successful collective adaptation
  to the diverse resources of Borneo's forests.
