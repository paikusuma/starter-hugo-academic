 abstract = {Abstract Theories of early cooperation in human society often
draw from a small sample of ethnographic studies of surviving
populations of hunter--gatherers, most of which are now
sedentary. Borneo hunter--gatherers (Punan, Penan) have seldom
figured in comparative research because of a decades-old
controversy about whether they are the descendants of farmers
who adopted a hunting and gathering way of life. In 2018 we
began an ethnographic study of a group of still-nomadic
hunter--gatherers who call themselves Punan Batu (Cave Punan).
Our genetic analysis clearly indicates that they are very
unlikely to be the descendants of neighbouring agriculturalists.
They also preserve a song language that is unrelated to other
languages of Borneo. Dispersed travelling groups of Punan Batu
with fluid membership use message sticks to stay in contact,
co-operate and share resources as they journey between rock
shelters and forest camps. Message sticks were once widespread
among nomadic Punan in Borneo, but have largely disappeared in
sedentary Punan villages. Thus the small community of Punan Batu
offers a rare glimpse of a hunting and gathering way of life
that was once widespread in the forests of Borneo, where
prosocial behaviour extended beyond the face-to-face community,
facilitating successful collective adaptation to the diverse
resources of Borneo's forests.},
