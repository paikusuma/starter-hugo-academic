abstract: Lack of diversity in human genomics limits our understanding of the genetic
  underpinnings of complex traits, hinders precision medicine, and contributes to
  health disparities. To map genetic effects on gene regulation in the underrepresented
  Indonesian population, we have integrated genotype, gene expression, and CpG methylation
  data from 115 participants across three island populations that capture the major
  sources of genomic diversity in the region. In a comparison with European datasets,
  we identify eQTLs shared between Indonesia and Europe as well as population-specific
  eQTLs that exhibit differences in allele frequencies and/or overall expression levels
  between populations. By combining local ancestry and archaic introgression inference
  with eQTLs and methylQTLs, we identify regulatory loci driven by modern Papuan ancestry
  as well as introgressed Denisovan and Neanderthal variation. GWAS colocalization
  connects QTLs detected here to hematological traits, and further comparison with
  European datasets reflects the poor overall transferability of GWAS statistics across
  diverse populations. Our findings illustrate how population-specific genetic architecture,
  local ancestry, and archaic introgression drive variation in gene regulation across
  genetically distinct and in admixed populations and highlight the need for performing
  association studies on non-European populations.
