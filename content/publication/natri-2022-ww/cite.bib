 abstract = {Lack of diversity in human genomics limits our understanding of
the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, hinders precision
medicine, and contributes to health disparities. To map genetic
effects on gene regulation in the underrepresented Indonesian
population, we have integrated genotype, gene expression, and
CpG methylation data from 115 participants across three island
populations that capture the major sources of genomic diversity
in the region. In a comparison with European datasets, we
identify eQTLs shared between Indonesia and Europe as well as
population-specific eQTLs that exhibit differences in allele
frequencies and/or overall expression levels between
populations. By combining local ancestry and archaic
introgression inference with eQTLs and methylQTLs, we identify
regulatory loci driven by modern Papuan ancestry as well as
introgressed Denisovan and Neanderthal variation. GWAS
colocalization connects QTLs detected here to hematological
traits, and further comparison with European datasets reflects
the poor overall transferability of GWAS statistics across
diverse populations. Our findings illustrate how
population-specific genetic architecture, local ancestry, and
archaic introgression drive variation in gene regulation across
genetically distinct and in admixed populations and highlight
the need for performing association studies on non-European
populations.},
