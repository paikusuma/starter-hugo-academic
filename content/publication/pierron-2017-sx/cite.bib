 abstract = {Although situated ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa,
Madagascar exhibits cultural, linguistic, and genetic traits from
both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. The settlement history
remains contentious; we therefore used a grid-based approach to
sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including
maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data)
across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals. We find a
common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy
individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and
the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened
recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the
last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian
ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex
biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting
independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia
rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In
addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic
diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few
centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure
in human populations.},
