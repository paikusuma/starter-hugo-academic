abstract: Although situated ∼400 km from the east coast of Africa, Madagascar exhibits
  cultural, linguistic, and genetic traits from both Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa.
  The settlement history remains contentious; we therefore used a grid-based approach
  to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages,
  paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy
  individuals. We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals
  with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture
  and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar
  during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry
  across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously
  across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa
  and Asia rather than settlement by an already admixed population. In addition, there
  are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture,
  showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure
  in human populations.
