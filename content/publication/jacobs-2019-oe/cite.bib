 abstract = {Genome sequences are known for two archaic hominins-Neanderthals
and Denisovans-which interbred with anatomically modern humans
as they dispersed out of Africa. We identified high-confidence
archaic haplotypes in 161 new genomes spanning 14 island groups
in Island Southeast Asia and New Guinea and found large
stretches of DNA that are inconsistent with a single
introgressing Denisovan origin. Instead, modern Papuans carry
hundreds of gene variants from two deeply divergent Denisovan
lineages that separated over 350 thousand years ago. Spatial and
temporal structure among these lineages suggest that
introgression from one of these Denisovan groups predominantly
took place east of the Wallace line and continued until near the
end of the Pleistocene. A third Denisovan lineage occurs in
modern East Asians. This regional mosaic suggests considerable
complexity in archaic contact, with modern humans interbreeding
with multiple Denisovan groups that were geographically isolated
from each other over deep evolutionary time.},
