abstract: Genome sequences are known for two archaic hominins-Neanderthals and Denisovans-which
  interbred with anatomically modern humans as they dispersed out of Africa. We identified
  high-confidence archaic haplotypes in 161 new genomes spanning 14 island groups
  in Island Southeast Asia and New Guinea and found large stretches of DNA that are
  inconsistent with a single introgressing Denisovan origin. Instead, modern Papuans
  carry hundreds of gene variants from two deeply divergent Denisovan lineages that
  separated over 350 thousand years ago. Spatial and temporal structure among these
  lineages suggest that introgression from one of these Denisovan groups predominantly
  took place east of the Wallace line and continued until near the end of the Pleistocene.
  A third Denisovan lineage occurs in modern East Asians. This regional mosaic suggests
  considerable complexity in archaic contact, with modern humans interbreeding with
  multiple Denisovan groups that were geographically isolated from each other over
  deep evolutionary time.
