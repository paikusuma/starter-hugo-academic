abstract: At the dawn of the second millennium, the expansion of the Indian Ocean
  trading network aligned with the emergence of an outward-oriented community along
  the East African coast to create a cosmopolitan cultural and trading zone known
  as the Swahili Corridor. On the basis of analyses of new genome-wide genotyping
  data and uniparental data in 276 individuals from coastal Kenya and the Comoros
  islands, along with large-scale genetic datasets from the Indian Ocean rim, we reconstruct
  historical population dynamics to show that the Swahili Corridor is largely an eastern
  Bantu genetic continuum. Limited gene flows from the Middle East can be seen in
  Swahili and Comorian populations at dates corresponding to historically documented
  contacts. However, the main admixture event in southern insular populations, particularly
  Comorian and Malagasy groups, occurred with individuals from Island Southeast Asia
  as early as the 8th century, reflecting an earlier dispersal from this region. Remarkably,
  our results support recent archaeological and linguistic evidence-based suggestions
  that the Comoros archipelago was the earliest location of contact between Austronesian
  and African populations in the Swahili Corridor.
