 abstract = {At the dawn of the second millennium, the expansion of the Indian
Ocean trading network aligned with the emergence of an
outward-oriented community along the East African coast to create
a cosmopolitan cultural and trading zone known as the Swahili
Corridor. On the basis of analyses of new genome-wide genotyping
data and uniparental data in 276 individuals from coastal Kenya
and the Comoros islands, along with large-scale genetic datasets
from the Indian Ocean rim, we reconstruct historical population
dynamics to show that the Swahili Corridor is largely an eastern
Bantu genetic continuum. Limited gene flows from the Middle East
can be seen in Swahili and Comorian populations at dates
corresponding to historically documented contacts. However, the
main admixture event in southern insular populations,
particularly Comorian and Malagasy groups, occurred with
individuals from Island Southeast Asia as early as the 8th
century, reflecting an earlier dispersal from this region.
Remarkably, our results support recent archaeological and
linguistic evidence-based suggestions that the Comoros
archipelago was the earliest location of contact between
Austronesian and African populations in the Swahili Corridor.},
