abstract: Western Eurasia, notably the Near East and South Asia (Indian sub-continent),
  has interacted with Indonesia through Indian Ocean trade (the Maritime Silk Route)
  for more than 2000 years. The Indianization, and later Islamization, of Indonesia
  was enacted largely through trading activities, but also spread with help from the
  many Indianized and Islamic kingdoms that reigned over parts of the Indonesian archipelago
  during this time. Western Eurasian interaction left behind not only imported trade
  goods and cultural features, but also genetic traces. To locate the primary areas
  of Western Eurasian genetic influence in Indonesia, we have assembled published
  uniparental genetic data from ∼2900 Indonesian individuals. Frequency distributions
  show that Western Eurasian paternal lineages are found more commonly than Western
  Eurasian maternal lineages. Furthermore, the origins of these paternal lineages
  are more diverse than the corresponding maternal lineages, predominantly tracing
  back to South West and South Asia, and the Indian sub-continent, respectively. Indianized
  kingdoms in the Indonesian archipelago likely played a major role in dispersing
  Western Eurasian lineages, as these kingdoms overlap geographically with the current
  distribution of individuals carrying Western Eurasian genetic markers. Our data
  highlight the important role of these Western Eurasian migrants in contributing
  to the complexity of genetic diversity across the Indonesian archipelago today.
