 abstract = {Western Eurasia, notably the Near East and South Asia (Indian
sub-continent), has interacted with Indonesia through Indian
Ocean trade (the Maritime Silk Route) for more than 2000 years.
The Indianization, and later Islamization, of Indonesia was
enacted largely through trading activities, but also spread with
help from the many Indianized and Islamic kingdoms that reigned
over parts of the Indonesian archipelago during this time.
Western Eurasian interaction left behind not only imported trade
goods and cultural features, but also genetic traces. To locate
the primary areas of Western Eurasian genetic influence in
Indonesia, we have assembled published uniparental genetic data
from ∼2900 Indonesian individuals. Frequency distributions show
that Western Eurasian paternal lineages are found more commonly
than Western Eurasian maternal lineages. Furthermore, the
origins of these paternal lineages are more diverse than the
corresponding maternal lineages, predominantly tracing back to
South West and South Asia, and the Indian sub-continent,
respectively. Indianized kingdoms in the Indonesian archipelago
likely played a major role in dispersing Western Eurasian
lineages, as these kingdoms overlap geographically with the
current distribution of individuals carrying Western Eurasian
genetic markers. Our data highlight the important role of these
Western Eurasian migrants in contributing to the complexity of
genetic diversity across the Indonesian archipelago today.},
