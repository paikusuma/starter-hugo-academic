abstract: AbstractPathogens found within local environments are a major cause of morbidity
  and mortality. This is particularly true in Indonesia, where infectious diseases
  such as malaria or dengue are a significant part of the disease burden within the
  country. One way to strengthen the control of infectious diseases is through better
  surveillance, however unequal investment in medical funding throughout Indonesia,
  particularly in rural areas, has resulted in under-reporting of cases. Here, we
  use transcriptome data from 117 healthy individuals living on the islands of Mentawai,
  Sumba, and the Indonesian side of New Guinea Island to explore which pathogens are
  present within whole blood. We are able to detect a broad range of taxa within RNA-sequencing
  data generated from whole blood, including bacteria, viruses, archaea, and eukaryotes.
  Using independent component analysis, we find that two of these pathogens---Flaviviridae
  and Plasmodium---have the most noticeable effects on expression profiles. We also
  identify specific genes linked with Plasmodium and Flavivirus abundance and find
  that both of these infections are most pronounced in the easternmost island within
  our Indonesian dataset. This study provides a framework for novel applications of
  RNA-seq as surveillance and a better understanding of environmental contributors
  affecting gene expression within Indonesia.
