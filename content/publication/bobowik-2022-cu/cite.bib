 abstract = {AbstractPathogens found within local environments are a major
cause of morbidity and mortality. This is particularly true in
Indonesia, where infectious diseases such as malaria or dengue
are a significant part of the disease burden within the country.
One way to strengthen the control of infectious diseases is
through better surveillance, however unequal investment in
medical funding throughout Indonesia, particularly in rural
areas, has resulted in under-reporting of cases. Here, we use
transcriptome data from 117 healthy individuals living on the
islands of Mentawai, Sumba, and the Indonesian side of New Guinea
Island to explore which pathogens are present within whole blood.
We are able to detect a broad range of taxa within RNA-sequencing
data generated from whole blood, including bacteria, viruses,
archaea, and eukaryotes. Using independent component analysis, we
find that two of these pathogens---Flaviviridae and
Plasmodium---have the most noticeable effects on expression
profiles. We also identify specific genes linked with Plasmodium
and Flavivirus abundance and find that both of these infections
are most pronounced in the easternmost island within our
Indonesian dataset. This study provides a framework for novel
applications of RNA-seq as surveillance and a better
understanding of environmental contributors affecting gene
expression within Indonesia.},
